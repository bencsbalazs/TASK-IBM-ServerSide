# IBM task
This is the IBM task with server side requests throught endpoints.

After login button is clicked, the facebook page makes the login, and take back the control to the application with the token needed. The app stores the token in a session for further use. Then sends the requests to facebook endpoints with this token.

It uses PHP curl for server to server communication.

It uses the ibm cloud platform for server.

jQuery with Ajax adds the results to the HTML page, and Bootstrap framework takes care of the usal view.

The application can be found on https://facebook-connect.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/
